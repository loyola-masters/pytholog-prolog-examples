If run locally (Windows 11) pyswip cannot not connect to `swi-prolog`:
```
SWI-Prolog: [FATAL ERROR: at Wed Jan 08 20:31:44 2025
        Could not find system resources]
```` 
Run in the cloud instead, in Google Colab for example, where you will need to install swi-prolog first:
```bash
!sudo apt install swi-prolog
```
